## Attempt 1

### Action

I am a bit ill at the moment.

In the text below I'll try to describe what I did. I was not measuring the ingredients, 
so you have to eyeball everything. I was aiming for one portion of the dish but ended up
with almost two.

I diced /a third of?/ the chicken breast into bite-sized cubes and marinated it in soy sauce, 
starch and oil for about two hours. I forgot to salt it, but luckily the soy sauce was already 
salty enough. I fried the cubes in a hot pan, lightly coated with olive oil /to minimize the 
oil flavor/, aiming to get a golden brown color and a soft texture. I decided not to shuffle 
them much and ended up burning sides of some of them. Luckily, I noticed it early in the process 
and the chicken turned out ver much to my liking /soft and moist, though you could feel the 
starch/. I liked it, my brother liked it.

Into a boiling pot of salted water,  I put the /eyeballed/ fettuccine and cooked /and tasted/ it 
until I liked the texture. Then I scooped a tea cup of fettuccine water and poured the rest out.
I added a softened cube of butter into the pot with the fettuccine and started stirring it. Once
the butter coated the pasta, I went in with the grated grana padano. The cheese sucked out the 
moisture and did not dissolve completely, so I had to add the pasta water I saved up earlier. 
I was adding cheese and water, and stirring it, until I got the desired flavor and consistency. 
Next, I added the fried chicken breast and some coarse ground black pepper, and gave it a last mix. 

I plated the dish, grated some parmigiano reggiano on it, a bit of coarse black pepper, and that 
was it.

I liked it, my brother liked it /he was full so had just a taste/.

### Outtakes

* Less starch /, no soy sauce?,/ and slightly more lower fire with the chicken breast.
* A lot of undissolved grana padano at the bottom of the pot in the end. Next time I will 
  add water before cheese the first time, see if it helps.
* The more you stir the pasta and the ingredients, the mushier it gets, so stir wisely.

## Attempt 2

### Action

The action was more or less the same. This time I was cooking for three, the previous one
was a solo action, so that threw me off.

### Outtakes

* The *less starch* idea was good
* This time I added too much cheese and the whole thing got too mushy. Need more water.
